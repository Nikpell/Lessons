By the 2nd week I started noticing my dreams and frequency of them. I was able to give up a lot of my smoking. Didnt really feel like I wanted to smoke either. By the 3rd week. I was going through a bad rash, hellish nightmares, violent nightmares, somewhat suicidal dreams, stomach flu like symptoms, nasty irritability,  I was in full blown quot;side effects hellquot; I called my Dr and asked what to do- she immediately pulled me off of them. I still personally feel that the way it affects your brain and the known side effects that people on it should consult with a Psycologist during the process.",Negative,2024-06-02T08:49:54.971749Z

It really does work, just have to stay on it for a while longer. I loved to smoke and have been doing so for a long time and hope this time I will quit for good.

I am cigarette free now for 7 weeks, and there are times that I would happily sell everyone I knew into slavery(yes an exageration) for a smoke, but these have become much fewer, and also much less intense.  To point now I had one today, the first this week, and it lasted a couple seconds and was gone.  Compared to how it was before using this, when it would result in an hours of restlessness until I got a cigarrette. 



I would recommend to anyone wanting to stop, it will still take willpower, but this will make those low times much easier to handle, and also make them fewer.",Positive,2024-06-02T08:53:16.237754Z

I was never successful in stopping smoking more than a couple of days. I started taking Chantix and after a couple of days the cigarettes start to taste terrible, not enjoyable at all. Day 5, I bought what I thought was going to be my last pack of cigarettes. I smoked two out of the pack and there are 18 left in the pack in my bedroom.

During the first week I had dropped from a pack a day to two or three cigarettes a day. I have currently been smoke free for over a week and a half. I have no desire and the smell is terrible. The strange dreams cause me to lose a lot of sleep and the nausea has been very bad, causing me to cut my pills down to half a 1mg twice a day. My boyfriend is also taking the pills and after day three became very irritable for a while and has now leveled back out.

I smoked my last cigarette on 02/09/2015 and not one since. There is a big difference between the physical craving, and the physical habit. Chantix takes away the physical craving completely, as for the physical habit, thats up to the person.. I recommend picking up some hard candy, and staying as busy as you can for the first few weeks. Best of luck to all. Its really not as hard to quit as you think. I smoked for over 40 years, and up to 3 packs a day when I quit..",Positive,2024-06-02T09:05:53.251899Z

Have tried to quit before, but champix is the best, effortless not even missing my morning fag with my coffee. If ur thinking of taking these tablets Id say go for it. Time for an update, almost week 3 of no smoking, had lots of cravings but stuck with it and came out ok, water really helps small sips or get a jigsaw to keep the hands busy, even my non smoking husband is impressed, hes heard so many times that Im going to quit but have failed every time apart from now and a healthier bank account.",Positive,2024-06-02T09:07:27.676045Z

What it does is change your brain chemistry to like you never smoked; consequently, you dont have any inclination to even want a cigarette!  I have never smoked since nor had any desire to.

And if it says they are smoke free for years, it is probably a bought comment by Pfizer. Trust me. I did quit as well 3 times, but it is not permanent. The side effects last even months after you take the pill. the last time I quit with it, I had a neurological breakdown, I could not control my body, I was having a non fatal stroke and even heart attack. I could not talk, had to be taken to the emergency. My eyes were rolling up, I could not control my limbs, could not talk, my mouth would not move to talk. It was horrible.

I decided its now or never I just want to be a non smoker so badly.  I went and got a prescription for zyban 4 days ago and started immediately. So far I feel ok on it, I definitely feel different, time feels slower and I feel like Im observing things differently in somewhat removed.

I attempted to quit countless times but this time with Chantix,I can finally say,Im a non-smoker and it feels great! When I initially started the starter pack I chose a quit day.
That wasnt a good choice for me because I stressed a little more each day it got closer.So I chose to keep taking Chantix regularly and see what happens. On my 27th day I didnt smoke.(I didnt even sneak) No more spending half the time on our family vacations looking for a smoking section.
